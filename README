If you're like me and run an IRC client on a machine (server) that's
always online, but don't look at it (and/or its X notifications don't
reach you since for example it's separated from your desktop through
VNC), but would still like to be notified if someone "pings" you, then
this might be for you. It will parse Xchat's log messages, queue up
what's said to you, then when you don't say anything on any channel
within 120 seconds, send the queued up messages to you by email (one
email per channel).


INSTALL:

 # mkdir -p /opt/chj
 # cd /opt/chj
 # git clone https://github.com/pflanze/chj-bin.git bin
 # git clone https://github.com/pflanze/chj-perllib.git perllib
 # git clone https://github.com/pflanze/irc2mail.git 

USE:

 * start Xchat
 * enable logging in Xchat
 * start irc2mail:

   $ irc2mail yournick you@yourdomain.org

   # you could use daemonize from /opt/chj/bin
   daemonize --bg --out irc2mail.errs -- irc2mail/irc2mail yournick your@email.org
